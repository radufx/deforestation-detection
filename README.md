Inside the notebook file I highlighted which code was reused from the internet but I will add a summary here too:
- used several graph plotting functions from the internet (marked in the code)
- added & tested several CNN layers on top of the ResNet50 all by myself
- manually tuned hyperparameters and tested with several activation functions/optimizers
